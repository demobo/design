                <h1 class="section-heading">How Subscription Form Works</h1>

                <p>Any visitor of your page is able to submit his email to subscribe for news. The subscription form uses javascript to send AJAX request to <em>subscribe.php</em> script. The script validates submitted email, and if it is valid, the script saves the address to <em>subscription_list.txt</em> file and sends an email (which is set up in <em>email.config.php</em>) to the user.</p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h1 class="section-heading">Customization</h1>

                <p>All customization is done in two configuration files: <em>main.config.js</em> and <em>email.config.php</em>. The first one allows you to change countdown date and messages which are showed to a user when he submits his email address. The second one is reponsible for subscription email settings.</p>
